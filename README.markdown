# Overview

This is a basic client-side javascript application template for the Dojo
Toolkit, version 1.7 using asynchronous module definitions (AMD). It is
based on Colin Snover's client+server boilerplate
(https://github.com/csnover/dojo-boilerplate).

## Note on the Repository

The dojo, dojox, dijit, and util directories within the src directory are
subtrees managed with the external tool git-subtree (https://github.com/apenwarr/git-subtree).
This tool is required neither for developing a project using this boilerplate nor 
developing the boilerplate itself. But this tool is required to update the 
library versions from their current state.
